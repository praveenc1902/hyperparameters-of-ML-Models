random_state
This is setting a random seed. It is useful if we want to reproduce exact clusters over and over again. 
We can set it to any number we want.

n_clusters :
We need to provide the algorithm with the number of clusters that we want. Standard literature suggests 
we use the elbow method to determine how many clusters we need and it works well for Scikitsâ€™ cleaned theoretical datasets.

n_init :
Number of times the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid seeds. 
The final results is the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia. 
Several runs are recommended for sparse high-dimensional problems (see Clustering sparse data with k-means).
When n_init='auto', the number of runs depends on the value of init: 10 if using init='random', 1 if using init='k-means++'.

max_iter :
There are n_init runs in general and each run iterates max_iter times, i.e.,
within a run, points will be assigned to different clusters and the loss calculated for max_iter times.
