n_neighborsint, default=5
Number of neighbors to use by default for kneighbors queries.

weights{‘uniform’, ‘distance’}
‘uniform’ : uniform weights. All points in each neighborhood are weighted equally.

‘distance’ : weight points by the inverse of their distance. in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a greater influence than neighbors which are further away.

p :
When p = 1, this is equivalent to using manhattan_distance 
When p=2 this is equivalent to using euclidean_distance
