max_depth : 
The max_depth of a tree in Random Forest is defined as the longest path between the root node and the leaf node

min_sample_split ::
is a parameter that tells the decision tree in a random forest the minimum required number of observations in any given node in order to split it.

max_leaf_nodes ::
This hyperparameter sets a condition on the splitting of the nodes in the tree and hence restricts the growth of the tree. 

min_sample_leaf ::
This specifies the minimum number of samples that should be present in the leaf node after splitting a node.

n_estimators :: total no of decision tree models in the random forest 

max_samples ::
determines what fraction of the original dataset is given to any individual tree.

max_features ::
the number of maximum features provided to each tree in a random forest.
