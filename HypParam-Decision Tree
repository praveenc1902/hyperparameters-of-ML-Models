min_impurity_decrease :
As the tree gets deeper, the amount of impurity decrease becomes lower. We can use this to prevent the tree from doing further splits. 
The hyperparameter for this task is min_impurity_decrease. It is set to zero by default (0.2/0.3)

Min_impurity_split :
is parameter can be used to control the tree based on impurity values. It sets a threshold on gini. For instance, 
if min_impurity_split is set to 0.3, a node needs to have a gini value that is more then 0.3 to be further splitted

max_depth: 
it is to control the depth of a tree. It does not make any calculations regarding impurity or sample ratio. 
The model stops splitting when max_depth is reached.

min_samples_leaf:
It indicates the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. We need to be careful when using hyperparameters together.

max_leaf_nodes :
We can also limit the number of leaf nodes using max_leaf_nodes parameter which grows the tree in best-first fashion until max_leaf_nodes reached. The best split is decided based on impurity decrease.

max_features :
which is the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. 
If not specified, the model considers all of the features. There are 13 features in our dataset. 
If we set max_features as 5, the model randomly selects 5 features to decide on the next split.
